# Doggies Gallery

This is a landing page that simulates a gallery of dog pictures where you can see random photos or gifs of dogs, add them to your gallery of favorite dogs, and upload your own pictures to the API.
This is a project of the course of API Rest with JavaScript at Platzi. This application was released to production using Github Pages. You can see a preview in this [link](https://lauraatenciob.github.io/doggies-gallery/).
